        <h1 style="text-align: center">WRITING A BUSINESS PLAN</h1>
        <div>
          <h2>Introduction</h2>
          <p>
            Writing a business plan is an important step in starting or
            expanding any business. It assists the business owner by organizing
            information that describes the business and its operation. As such,
            it becomes a guide for creating strategic plans to develop a
            business or to better manage an existing business. A business plan
            can also provide the information that must be presented to a bank or
            other investor before a credit decision is made. Whether you use
            your own funds or borrowed funds to start up or expand your
            business, the development of reliable and complete information in a
            business plan is essential
          </p>
          <h2>What a bank looks for in a business plan</h2>
          <p>
            Since your business plan may be submitted to a bank, it is important
            to realize how a banker analyzes a business plan and what questions
            a banker asks during this analysis. A banker’s job is to assess the
            degree of risk in each proposed loan and to be satisfied that the
            loan can be repaid by the borrower while still allowing the business
            to operate profitably. A banker does this by analyzing a number of
            things including
          </p>
          <ul style="margin-left: 30px">
            <li>the nature of the business</li>
            <li>the purpose of the loan</li>
            <li>the amount of the loan</li>
            <li>the ability to repay the loan</li>
            <li>the collateral available to secure the loan</li>
            <li>the character and management skills of the business owner</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            To convince a banker (or any other investor) of the merits of a loan
            request, a borrower must present complete, well-organized
            information which addresses these and other concerns. It is
            important to remember that the proper packaging of a loan proposal
            can be an important step in getting it approved

        <h1 style="text-align: center"><u>Cycle-Rama Business Plan</u></h1>

        <h3><u>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY (COVER LETTER)</u></h3>
        <p>
          Cycle-Rama will be a specialty bicycle retailer that will sell five
          types of high quality and high performance bicycles. Our bicycle shop
          will provide top notch customer service, including proper bike
          fittings, instruction on proper use, and safety tips. We will perform
          repairs, upgrades, adjustments, and tune-ups for all types and sizes
          of bicycles. Cycle-Rama will also provide a wide selection of the
          industry’s best bicycle parts, accessories, clothing and shoes.
        </p>
        <p>
          According to the Bicycle Retailer and Industry News, 2005 was a good
          year for the specialty retailer, as store revenue and net operating
          profit were up. Industry revenues soared to 1.3 billion dollars,
          commanding roughly 16% of the market in terms of unit sales, but
          accounting for 47% of the dollars, a dominant dollar share.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our target market are those age 6 to 65 years old who enjoy bicycling,
          whether for sport, exercise, or recreation. We plan to further segment
          our market into two smaller, identifiable groups and reach them with a
          focused marketing plan. The first group is families with children that
          have an average income of $35,000 or higher. The second group is the
          avid rider, or bicycle enthusiast, male and female, age 21-44 with an
          average income of $45,000 or higher. Our Marketing Plan demonstrates
          how we will reach these segments
        </p>
        <p>
          There are three competitors located in the greater Abbotville area,
          none of which are specialty bicycle retailers. One is a nationwide
          discount retailer offering only a limited number of inexpensive
          bicycles, one is a sporting goods store that is struggling financially
          and might close, and the other is a small bike shop located 15 miles
          west of Abbotville and carries a very limited selection of road
          bicycles.
        </p>
        <p>
          Cycle-Rama is seeking a loan of $80,000 in addition to a $25,000 owner
          investment to finance the lease of a building, make renovations,
          purchase inventory and equipment, and provide working capital for
          growth and development. We would like five years to repay the loan,
          using the expected proceeds from the business. The inventory,
          equipment and personal assets will provide adequate collateral to
          secure the loan.
        </p>

        <h3><u>BUSINESS DESCRIPTION</u></h3>
        <p>
          Cycle-Rama will specialize in selling five types of high quality and
          high performance bicycles to retail customers. The five types of
          bicycles are: 1) Mountain Bikes, including front suspension, full
          suspension, and no suspension, 2) Road Bikes, 3) Comfort bikes, which
          are geared toward the recreational user, 4) Hybrid bikes that perform
          on and off road, and 5) Youth bikes for kids of all ages. Cycle-Rama
          will carry 5 brands of bicycles: Trek, Specialized, Giant, Raleigh
          America, and Haro Bikes, all of which are top sellers in the specialty
          retail market. Trek and Specialized combined to capture more than half
          of the specialty retail market, with 32 and 22 percent, respectively,
          of total units sold (<a href="http//:www.bicycleretailer.com"
            >www.bicycleretailer.com</a
          >).

      <!-- PAGE 4 STARTS -->
      <section class="pg4">
        <p>
          We will also provide a wide selection of the industry’s best bicycle
          parts and accessories, namely, helmets, locks, clothing, shoes, racks,
          cycle computers, tires, tubes, wheels, saddles, gloves, hydration,
          lighting systems, pedals, pumps, tools and lubricants. According to a
          survey of 613 bicycling enthusiasts by International Cycling Works,
          62% of cyclists purchase the majority of cycling products from their
          local bike shop (<a href="http//:www.bicycleretailer.com"
            >www.bicycleretailer.com</a
          >). In addition to these high quality products, CycleRama will provide
          personalized, fun, and one-of-a-kind customer service, including
          proper bike fittings, instruction on safety and proper use, repairs,
          upgrades, adjustments, and tune-ups.
        </p>
        <p>
          Abbotville's demographic characteristics and location make it an ideal
          place to open a bicycle shop. The city has a large population of
          children and young adults, which are segments of the population that
          are heavy users of bicycles. Also, with a large state university only
          one mile away, we expect to attract a number of college customers. We
          will be the only specialty retailer in the area and only the second in
          the state. We are confident that our store will flourish in the city
          of Abbotville, which is a hot spot for bicycle enthusiasts with over
          fifty miles of trails. These factors lead us to believe that
          Abbotville is a perfect place to open a bicycle dealership
        </p>

        <h3><u>OPERATIONS AND LOCATION</u></h3>
        <p>
          The business will be open six days a week, from 10:00 a.m. to 6:00
          p.m. on weekdays and from 10:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m. on Saturdays. Demand
          for bicycles is seasonal and we may need to adjust our schedule as
          demand fluctuates, possibly closing the store for a month or so during
          the winter season.
        </p>
        <p>
          We will purchase our bicycle inventory from H & J Wholesalers of
          Boston, MA. They distribute all five of the brands we intend to sell
          at Cycle-Rama: Trek, Specialized, Giant, Raleigh America, and Haro
          Bikes.
        </p>
        <p>
          We believe that we have found an ideal location for the business. We
          intend to operate CycleRama from a 2500 square foot building on the
          corner of Main Street and Bourne Avenue in downtown Abbotville. This
          is a high traffic area located in the city’s historic downtown
          district. We will have easy access to major highways, railways and
          airports. The building itself will need some renovations in order to
          make it suitable for our needs. We intend to partition the building
          into the following areas: (1) showroom (1000 square feet); (2) office
          area (300 square feet); (3) service area (300 square feet); and (4)
          other space for restroom and storage (900 square feet). We feel that
          this building offers more than adequate space and will meet our needs
          for the foreseeable future. All products will be distributed from this
          location, and all bicycle repairs and service will be performed at
          this location
        </p>

        <h3><u>MARKET/INDUSTRY ANALYSIS</u></h3>
        <p>
          The U.S. bicycle industry was a $6 billion industry in 2005 (this
          includes the retail value of bicycles, related parts, and accessories
          through all channels of distribution), selling approximately 19
          million bicycles, according to the National Bicycle Dealers
          Association 2006 Industry Overview (NBDA;
          <a href="#">www.nbda.com</a>). The industry has benefited greatly as
          Americans have become more aware of the positive affects associated
          with a healthy lifestyle. Bicycling is

          an excellent cardiovascular exercise and a great stress reliever. A
          recent industry trade publication showed that 94.5% of those who ride
          bicycles do so for recreation or fitness. The sport is continuing to
          grow as more and more people become aware of its health benefits. The
          Bicycle industry and Cycle-Rama in particular, is positioned to cash
          in on this trend.
        </p>
        <p>
          As stated earlier, Cycle-Rama is a specialty bicycle retailer
          featuring high quality merchandise, and also offering additional
          customer services such as bike fitting, expert assembly, and repair.
          The approximately 4,800 specialty bicycle retailers in the U.S.
          commanded roughly 16% of the market in terms of unit sales in 2005,
          but accounted for 47% of the dollars, a dominant dollar share
          (Industry Overview 2006, NBDA). Store revenue at the typical bike shop
          increased 22 percent in 2005 compared to 2003.
        </p>
        <p>
          Since this will be Cycle-Rama’s first year in business we had to
          estimate our sales using national industry averages. According to
          research by the NBDA (<a href="#">www.nbda.com</a>), the average
          specialty bicycle retailer (offering bicycles, parts and accessories,
          and repair services) has gross sales of $514,250 per year. Because
          Cycle-Rama will be the only specialty bicycle retailer in this part of
          the state we assumed market share of 100%. However, we reduced our
          sales estimate by 25% for two reasons: 1) the national industry sales
          averages might not be reflective of the specialty bicycle retail
          market in Maine, and 2) we wanted to be conservative with our sales
          forecast, as this will be our first year in business. Thus, estimated
          sales for 2005 are $385,687.
        </p>
        <p>
          The bicycle industry in Maine is a seasonal business that can be
          impacted by poor weather conditions, as well as changes in the
          economy. Fortunately, the economy in Abbotville is strong with an
          unemployment rate of 3.6% and a median family income of $42,047 (U.S.
          Census Bureau). Additionally, high oil and gas prices have increased
          the demand for bicycles nation wide as people look for more affordable
          means of transportation. Approximately 5.2% of those who ride bicycles
          do so as a means of transportation.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is also important to note that Abbotville has two bicycle
          associations, the Abbotville Mountain Bike Association (AMBA) and
          Citizens for a Healthy Lifestyle (CHL). The AMBA has about 200 members
          who are serious trail riders and take advantage of Abbotville’s many
          miles of trails. In fact, Abbotville is home to Bear Mountain State
          Park, which is known for having the best mountain biking trails in the
          state. The CHL has about 100 members who are more casual riders that
          do mostly intermediate trail riding

        <h3><u>COMPETITION</u></h3>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0">
          Cycle-Rama’s current local competition includes the following:
        </p>
        <ul style="margin-top: 0; padding: 0 0 0 22px">
          <li>
            <u>George’s Department Store-</u> large nationwide discount retailer
            offering limited selection of bicycle and bicycle accessories
            located approximately 2 miles south of Cycle-Rama; products directed
            at those seeking inexpensive product; offers no instruction on safe
            and proper use of bicycles and does not do repairs.
          </li>
          <li>
            <u>Sports R Us-</u> sporting goods retail chain located 3 miles west
            of Cycle-Rama; rarely have more than 7 or 8 bicycles in stock at any
            given time; offers no services with bicycles; have been experiencing
            significant financial problems in the past year and are looking to

          <li>
            <u>Cykel Shop-</u> only independent bicycle shop in the area, but
            located 15 miles west of Abbotville; small operation with no more
            than 30 bicycles in stock and limited selection of bicycle
            accessories; shop has been slow to adapt to trends developing in the
            industry and just recently started selling mountain bikes, which
            accounted for 28.8% of bicycle sales in 2005 (NBDA;
            <a href="#">www.nbda.com</a>)

        <p>
          Each of our direct competitors has a limited selection of bicycles and
          does not service the bicycles they sell. Abbotville does not have an
          independent bicycle dealership and those wishing to purchase a higher
          quality product or who want to service their bicycles have been forced
          to travel elsewhere. We feel that Cycle-Rama will fill a niche in
          Abbotville. We will be the only store in town which not only sells
          bicycles but services them as well.

        <h3><u>MARKETING STRATEGY</u></h3>
        <p>
          Our marketing strategy is based on becoming the resource of choice for
          local bicycle users. We provide products for the casual biker who
          enjoys occasional recreational activity, for kids of all ages, and for
          the hardcore enthusiast. The marketing strategy will seek to first
          create customer awareness regarding the products and services offered,
          develop that customer base, establish connections with targeted
          markets and work toward building customer loyalty and referrals.
        </p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0">
          Our strategy is based on superior performance in the following areas:
        </p>
        <ul style="margin-top: 0; margin-left: 50px">
          <li>Product selection</li>
          <li>Product quality</li>
          <li>Customer service (including repairs and tune-ups)</li>
        </ul>

        <p style="margin-bottom: 0">
          Our marketing objectives include the following
        </p>
        <ul style="margin-top: 0; margin-left: 50px">
          <li>Maintain a gross margin of 40% each month</li>
          <li>Increase yearly sales by 5%</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Product and service pricing is based on offering high value to our
          customers. The price range for tune-ups and repairs will vary
          accordingly, but the following is a list of price ranges for our five
          types of bicycles:

          Cycle-Rama wants to be the retailer of choice for bicycle
          professionals and enthusiasts, but we also want to appeal to
          cost-efficient buyers. Thus, we will set up a pricing orientation with
          roughly half of our products in the inexpensive range ($200 to $599)
          and the other half in the expensive range ($600 to $1200).

          We will market our business using the following mediums: television,
          radio, and newspaper advertisements, business website, printed
          promotional materials, and promotional events. Our television and
          radio advertisements will be aired on local stations. We will place
          newspaper advertisements in two of the local papers and the local
          university’s paper. We will create a website for our business that
          will allow users to contact the store and view our complete list of
          products and services. We will also utilize print advertisements such
          as fliers and post cards to promote special sales events.

          Cycle-Rama will conduct bike maintenance and safety clinics at the
          local elementary schools. Each workshop will include a bike safety
          trial ride and obstacle course. Participants will receive a Cycle-Rama
          t-shirt. And finally, we will sponsor three competitors in the
          Abbotville Days Festival Mountain Bike Race held every July. To
          sponsor these individuals, we will pay the entry fees and all they
          have to do is wear our Cycle-Rama jersey and insignias. Our grand
          opening is scheduled for April 1st, 2005. We will extensively
          advertise our grand opening using the local media. We intend to raffle
          off a new mountain bike at our opening in the hopes of attracting a
          large crowd.

        <h3><u>MANAGEMENT/EMPLOYEES</u></h3>
        <p>
          Michael and Laurie Ross are a recently married couple who will be the
          owners of CycleRama. In 1993, Mr. Ross earned a Bachelor's degree in
          Accounting. Following college, he worked for two years at Sports
          Galore, a sporting goods retail outlet. Through his work at Sports
          Galore, Mr. Ross gained valuable experience in the areas of customer
          service, marketing and management. At Cycle-Rama, Mr. Ross will be
          responsible for store management, accounting and marketing. (See
          Michael Ross’ resume attached as Appendix A)
        </p>
        <p>
          Laurie Ross recently earned an Associate's Degree in Physical Fitness.
          She has worked on a parttime basis for the past three years as a
          cashier at a local discount retailer. Mrs. Ross is an avid cyclist and
          has competed in numerous bicycle races. She is very familiar with
          bicycles and bicycle accessories, safety issues, as well as bicycle
          repair and maintenance. Mrs. Ross will be in charge of sales and
          bicycle repair/service at Cycle-Rama. (See Laurie Ross’ resume
          attached as Appendix B)
        </p>
        <p>
          Michael and Laurie strongly believe that with their combined knowledge
          and skills, they will be able to make this business a success. Michael
          and Laurie will hire two part-time employees to help handle the
          increased demand from April through September. Michael and Laurie will
          not employ workers during the off-season to save money on personnel
          costs.

          We plan to start with an inventory of approximately 120 bicycles. The
          prices of these bicycles will range from $125-$1200. We also intend to
          carry a large selection of bicycle accessories. Of course, we will be
          able to order additional bicycles and accessories should we find an
          unexpected demand for a particular product. We will have a better
          understanding of the right product mix as time passes.
        </p>
        <p>
          Specialized tools and equipment will be needed to service some of the
          bicycles. Mrs. Ross has significant experience in bicycle repair and
          already possesses a number of tools. The business will need some
          additional equipment including a cash register and some assorted
          supplies.
        </p>
        <p>
          The renovations of our intended location on Main Street include:
          partitioning the building into four areas; installation of flooring in
          the showroom and service areas; replacing the existing heating system
          with a more modern and energy efficient one; installation of a counter
          and cash register; and, remodeling the restroom.
        </p>
        <p>
          The working capital will enable Cycle-Rama to meet current expenses
          and insure the growth of the business.

        <h3><u>SUMMARY</u></h3>
        <p>
          After carefully examining the market conditions, we have come to the
          conclusion that there is a strong demand for an independent bicycle
          dealership in Abbotville. There are very few businesses in the area
          where an individual can purchase a bicycle. The stores that do sell
          bicycles have a limited selection and they do not service the products
          that they sell. Cycle-Shop will not only sell bicycles and bicycle
          accessories, but service them as well.
        </p>
        <p>
          We feel that our promotional efforts and business location will
          generate the exposure necessary to enable us to achieve our sales
          goals. We firmly believe that our revenue and expense projections are
          realistic.
